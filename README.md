Goals for this week.
Allocation of what we need to do. – We need to divide the some of the code of the mini-projects- esp. mini project 14. 

	-Goal of this is to get our meaningful pushes out of the way.
In this class and the next class- Set up folder structure. 

Ideas: 
let’s start out with the simplest version;
google drive could be used to  image storage
Michael says
	-start getting views out there getting user and being able to authentic IE LOGIN AND 
SIGN UP PAGE (THEN go from there)

	- A GOOD GOAL: Get the folder structure setup and getting user to be able to 
authenticate. (THIS IS A GOOD AMOUNT OF WORK).

	-GET FOLDER STUCTURE (CLOSE TO THE MINI PROJECT 14. LOTS OF 
DATABASE USER SEQUILIZE MODELS THE VIEWs (AsSociated with logging and 
signing up and some of the controllers etc.) 

Think about what our MVP DEVIANT art page look like? upload pictures, then add more perhaps. Add comments, etc.

How to -GOOGLE- Uploading (DON’T USE Handlebars) There are services out there that can be used to be able to add and post 

We need to store both file name and file. – This could be taken from a template we find on google.
This will be found in a template on google per Michaels suggestions (or taken from your ideas Evan W)
Storage possibility- google photos api or media fire- 


ALLOCATIONS OF CODE-
Evan Williams-building an image uploader. Image storage implementation
Todd- building the login and signup and readme. Create profile.. can be found in mini project 14.
Henri-Create Profile together. 
Evan A.- handlebars.

*folders and files- Let’s set it up now.

SUBMIT EACH CHUNK OF CODE one at a time.

Evan Allan
Deviant art is using some kind of wrap effect- with different sizes.
-Our picture will be all the same size, etc. with the primary focus being making easy and 
looking clean af- 

Possible Solution: give it a set window size
Is it going to be a catalogue or 
	
SUGGESTIONS From EVAN W. friends.

-USE NODE LIKE WE KNOW HOW 
-USING FRONT END TO DISPLAY AND REFERENCE IN THE BACK END.
	-Could put the images in the repo

MVP DEVIANT ART PROJECTS HAS THESE FEATURES-
	the ability to sign up and log in
upload photos. Multer- could be the way we upload photos
	be able to see other people’s images. (possibly a feed of sorts)
